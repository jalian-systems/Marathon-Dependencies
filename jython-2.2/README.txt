Welcome to Jython 2.2
=======================
This is the 2.2 release of Jython, an implementation of the Python programming
language on the Java Virtual Machine.  2.2 is the first stable
release of Jython in nearly 6 years and is equivalent at a language level to
the 2.2 release of Python.  It contains many major new features from 2.1:
 - new-style classes
 - Java List integration
 - a PEP 302 implementation
 - iterators
 - generators
 - __future__ division
 - support for running on modern JVMs
 - a new installer
 - ssl and non-blocking support for socket

In addition to these features, many many bugs have been fixed in the meantime.
See the NEWS file for a more complete list of changes.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 but it should run on an JVM
with version 1.4.2 or later.

Bug reports can be created at http://jython.org/bugs whereas more general
questions can be sent to the Jython-users mailing list, 
jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
